# ATM

The ATM we have designed consists of multiple functionalities like deposit cash, withdraw cash, change pin, transfer funds, and view balance. We have also integrated structural and behavioral design patterns like facade and state respectively alongside the following two solid principles such as Single Responsibility and Open Close.

## Tools:
 This project was designed using swing for frontend, SQL via myphpadmin for backend on Netbeans IDE.


## Features:
● User signup and login- Creating users along with their login credentials and storing them using files.
